Tweet Analysis to find Adverse Drug Reactions of Allegra, Zyrtec and Claritin and  determine frequency of occurrence of common side effects.

The abundance of text available in social media and health related forums along with the rich expression of public opinion have recently attracted the interest of the public health community to use these sources to identify ADRs from their respective drugs. Based on the intuition that patients post about Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in Twitter expressing negative sentiments, we investigate the effect of sentiment analysis features in locating ADR mentions.
There are two goals of this project:
•	To identify adverse drug reaction of Allegra, Zyrtec and Claritin
•	Determine frequency of occurrence of common side effects
